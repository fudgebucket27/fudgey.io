            <h1>I've made an NFT explorer <small class="text-muted">January 14th, 2022</small></h1>
            <p>If you haven't been keeping up with Loopring's movements; they have just announced they are releasing an NFT Collection called <a href="https://www.loopheads.info/" target="_blank">Loopheads.</a></p>
            <p>These aren't your regular old NFTs. These will be dynamic and change accordingly to different scenarios. Pretty cool, eh?</p>
            <p>Anywho, there was no easy way to view all the different variations of the NFTs in the collection. So, I decided to create an NFT explorer for the Loopheads which can be found <a href="https://loopheadsexplorer.azurewebsites.net/" target="_blank">here.</a></p>
            <p>I've made the source code public and can be found in it's corresponding <a href="https://github.com/fudgebucket27/LoopheadsExplorer/tree/master" target="_blank">GitHub repository.</a></p>
            <p>Under the hood, the NFT explorer is a Blazor Server application. Basically the logic in the application does the following:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>On page load, get the ipfs links to each base NFT in the collection</li>
                <li>When you click the view variations button it will get the ipfs links to the variations metadata</li>
                <li>When you click on a variation it will get the metadata and grab the NFT image</li>
            </ol>
            <p>One thing I have found is that ipfs can be slow and returns weird errors from time to time so there is a retry mechanism built in place.</p>
            <p>This was a fun little project and I learnt a bit about ipfs in the process too. Let's see what else I can build in the future! :D</p>
