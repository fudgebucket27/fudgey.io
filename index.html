            <h1>Hi!</h1>
            <p>If you've just stumbled across my website, let me introduce myself. </p>
            <p class="lead">I'm Fudgey!</strong></p>
            <p>I currently work as an Application Developer for a mining and commodities company called Glencore.</p>
            <p>I'm involved in a number of duties in my role, ranging from application development to application support.</p>
            <p>One of my favourite aspects of my role is problem solving! I absolutely love developing solutions to issues that our users face.</p>
            <p>Lately, in my spare time outside of work, I have been delving into the world of cryptocurrency.</p>
            <p>I'm a big fan of what <a href="https://loopring.io/" target="_blank">Loopring</a> is doing with their Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum.</p>
            <p>One of the main hurdles for a C# developer like myself trying to develop for Loopring, is that there was no C# implementation of the Poseidon hashing function that is used to sign requests to Loopring's API.</p>
            <p>As a result of this, I created <a href="https://github.com/fudgebucket27/PoseidonSharp" target="_blank">PoseidonSharp</a>, a Poseidon hashing library for Loopring in C#.</p>
            <p>The original reference implementation for Poseidon was in Python so converting this into C# was no easy task to say the least. Let me just say I am not the biggest fan of the BigInteger type in C# as a result...</p>
            <p>There is still more work to do to get it into a state I'm happy but initial testing is looking good.</p>
            <p>Anywho that's it for now! If you want to get in touch, you can find me below on these other sites :)</p>
